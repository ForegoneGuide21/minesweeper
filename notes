I made it so that the timer only starts after the first click, I did this by only starting the timer start function after first click.  I also noticed that we didnt have a losing screen so I added that, I think the first click thing made it a lot harder becasue it broke the timer function, almost entirely but I fixed it.

and then it hit me, why overcomplicate the game

why add a best time, who cares abt their best time on minesweeper, some games wil be easier, and some games will be harder

ig we could add a main menu, we would have to make num_rows and columns a let or var or smthn

def mkae the sqaures scale though

idk if the scale(0.7) in css would be the best decision or if possible though

I think we gotta tweak the gerneration becuase it get annooying/unfair when you font havr any info, it only revaels one cell

We could prob piggy back off of first click and make it regenerate if theres a mine within 2 or 3 cells of the first click and run startboard again
